# Personal-Portfolio
A personal portfolio website created with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript is like your digital resume and showcase of your work. Here's a simple breakdown of how each technology plays a role:

1. HTML: It provides the structure of your website, like the layout of your content, text, and images. Think of it as the skeleton of your site.

2. CSS: This is for making your website look good. You use CSS to define colors, fonts, spacing, and how everything appears visually. It's like the paint and decoration.

3. JavaScript: It adds interactivity. JavaScript allows you to create things like interactive buttons, image sliders, or contact forms. It makes your site feel alive.

In a nutshell, HTML arranges your content, CSS makes it pretty, and JavaScript makes it work smoothly. Your portfolio showcases your skills and projects in a visually appealing and engaging way.
